# GPU media integration

The PipeWire producer accepts two explicit storage descriptions for one
XRGB8888 memory plane:

- `VideoBufferStorage::MappableLinear` preserves the existing CastKMS CPU
  capture path. The plane begins at offset zero, its modifier is linear, and
  PipeWire may advertise CPU mapping. The format offer omits a DRM modifier so
  the software consumer can negotiate ordinary raw-video caps.
- `VideoBufferStorage::DrmModifier { modifier, offset }` transports a layout
  supplied by a graphics allocator. The format offer includes the exact
  modifier, including zero. The allocation is not advertised as CPU-mappable.
  Negotiation must retain the modifier; a consumer cannot silently substitute
  a linear or implicit layout.

`VideoBufferLayout::size` is the whole allocation size, including any prefix
before the plane. PipeWire receives that whole size as `maxsize`, with the
plane's offset and the remaining allocation extent in its chunk. Every frame
publication restores those values. Pools require identical complete layouts,
including storage kind and offset.

For linear storage, validation checks pitch and complete rows after the
offset. For other modifiers, pitch times height is not a valid allocation-size
formula. The caller must obtain a valid, single-memory-plane description from
its graphics API and the receiving API must support importing it. The transport
checks dimensions, signed PipeWire field bounds and offset containment; it
does not validate vendor-specific tiling. Auxiliary memory planes and other
pixel formats are not supported by this initial adapter.

## Ownership and synchronization

The layout API does not submit GPU work or allocate buffers. Those operations
remain with the capture/executor owner, outside the PipeWire loop. In waited
transport, publication requires the caller to establish producer completion.
A `BufferReleased` event reports the end of PipeWire retention, not completion
of native GPU reads. Before rewriting storage, the owner must establish reader
completion as well, for example through a qualified DMA-BUF implicit-sync
bridge. Layout support alone does not establish that synchronization path.

Returning a buffer also does not revoke its exported storage. Pools must not
reuse backing allocations across incompatible recipient authorization scopes.

## Current scope

Existing application and live-test callers select `MappableLinear`; they do
not opt into GPU layouts automatically. Hardware encoding, GPU allocation,
native reuse-fence handling and service render-node access remain separate
integration work. The default software media graph and installed service
sandboxes are unchanged. A transport-level modifier test is not qualification
of the complete private PipeWire, encoder or receiver path.

Run `cargo test -p pronk-pipewire --lib` for layout-boundary, modifier-negotiation,
native metadata and existing ownership tests. The metadata tests use ordinary
descriptors without GPU access; they do not qualify a particular GPU modifier.
